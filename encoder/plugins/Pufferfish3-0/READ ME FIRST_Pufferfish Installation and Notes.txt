FIRST STEPS:
1. Delete any previous versions of Pufferfish you have installed.
2. Unzip the Pufferfish3-0.zip file. (Make sure you actually unzip the file, do not just drag the Pufferfish3-0.gha out of the zip file viewer)
3. UNBLOCK THE FILE - Right click the Pufferfish3-0.gha file > go to Properties > If you see a check box in the bottom right that says "Unblock", check it and hit Apply > OK.

*************99.9999999999% of the time that a Grasshopper Plug-in won't install is because you forgot to unblock the .gha file, please make sure you do by following step 3 above!*************

NEXT STEPS - for Rhino 5:

3. Place the Pufferfish3-0.gha file in that Libraries folder.
4. Completely close both Grasshopper and Rhino fully. 
5. Launch Rhino, then Grasshopper, you should now have a Pufferfish tab in Grasshopper. 

NEXT STEPS - for Rhino 6:
